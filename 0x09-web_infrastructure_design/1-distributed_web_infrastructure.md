1. Distributed Web Infrastructure
Introduction
This document outlines the design and components of a distributed web infrastructure for hosting a website accessible via www.foobar.com. By distributing the workload across multiple servers and employing redundancy, we aim to enhance the website's reliability, scalability, and availability.

Infrastructure Components
Servers
Multiple servers are used to host different parts of the web application stack. This includes separate servers for the web server, application server, and database, with redundancy for each to prevent a single point of failure (SPOF).
Web Servers (Nginx)
Several Nginx web servers are employed to distribute incoming traffic. These servers act as the first point of contact for user requests and serve static content directly while forwarding dynamic content requests to the application servers.
Application Servers
Multiple application servers run the website's backend logic. They process requests from the web servers, interact with the database or other services, and generate dynamic content to be served back to the web servers.
Databases (MySQL)
The infrastructure includes a primary database server and a replica for redundancy. Data is replicated in real-time to ensure high availability and reliability. The application servers can read from any replica to distribute the load.
Load Balancers
Load balancers are placed in front of the web servers and application servers to distribute incoming traffic evenly. This ensures no single server becomes a bottleneck, improving response times and reliability.
Domain Name System (DNS)
DNS is configured with multiple A records or with a service that supports DNS load balancing to distribute requests across multiple servers, improving response times and availability.
Redundancy and High Availability
Each component of the infrastructure is duplicated to eliminate single points of failure. Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server's failure will take the website offline. Data replication across database servers prevents data loss and downtime in case of a database server failure.

Scalability
The distributed nature of this infrastructure allows for horizontal scaling. Additional servers can be added to any component (web, application, or database) to handle increased load. This scalability ensures the website can maintain performance under varying load conditions.

Maintenance and Deployment
The distributed infrastructure allows for rolling updates and maintenance without downtime. Servers can be updated or maintained one at a time, with the load balancer redirecting traffic away from the server under maintenance.

Conclusion
A distributed web infrastructure offers significant advantages over a simple, single-server setup. By distributing the load across multiple servers and employing redundancy, the infrastructure achieves high availability, scalability, and reliability, ensuring the website remains accessible and performs well under any circumstances.
